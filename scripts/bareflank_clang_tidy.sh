# Once you have compiled Bareflank and created a compilation database,

# and why:
#
# - cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast: There are legit cases where we
#   need reinterpret_cast. As a result, we have disabled this. That being said,
#   each instance were it is used has been reviewed, and determined to be
#   needed. The remaining instances were removed in place of safer code.
#
# - cert-err58-cpp: This is triggered by catch.hpp which we need
#
